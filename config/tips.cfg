        Both copper and tin can be used for a starting Tetra material.
        The Tetra adze is your Tetra shovel.
        The Immersive Engineering Mining Drill is incredibly powerful once you get it for mining. It's reccomended to fill it out as soon as possible.
        While the Atomic Disassembler from Mekanism is craftable, it requires a lot of technology. If you want a multitool before it, use the REDIA Tool.
        Steel tetra tools will last you for quite some time until you have a REDIA and a drill. You may even want them past then. By the time you have an atomic disassembler, they're less useful.
        While it is physically possible to make a T4 hammer from steel, you'll need a T5 hammer to get it and it requires a lot of very special materials to get enough integrity. Just use the craftable steam-powered Forge Hammer.
        The Test Dummy allows you to check the damage of your sword or other weapon. Though you won't need it much, it can come in handy.
        Having problems with cave-ins? Fences will prevent them in a moderate area, scaffolding in a larger one. Metallic scaffolds are the best.
        For damage output, the Immersive Engineering railgun with DU Composite rods cannot be beat. Any rod in the railgun will beat most other weapons, but the railgun charges slowly and consumes large amounts of power, making the revolver a viable alternative.
        If you're having problems with storage, try either the Magneticraft shelving unit or Engineer's Decor labeled crates. Both will help with late-earlygame storage management.
        Some blocks like concrete can increase your movement speed when you walk on them.
        
        Villages hold considerable amounts of loot. Be sure to check every single house for lootables.
        All villages will hold a single waystone for fast travel - beware though, these waystones cannot be moved and new ones cannot be crafted, so if you want to take advantage of it, you need to set up near a village.
        If you start off in a desertlike biome and don't want to stay, head N/S for temperature or E/W for humidity changes.
        Total climate length from pole to pole is about 50k blocks. You don't need much in the last 10k blocks or so either direction unless you like cold biomes. Most of the time you don't even need to go that far.
        Some biomes are only mountainous. Some biomes are subbiomes of others. If you want a very specific biome, think about where in the world it would be placed temperature and humidity-wise and search there. If you can't find it, you probably need to find a mountain range for it to appear.
        Most mobs only come out on blood moons. While this may seem like it restricts some materials to unreasonable conditions, many of them can be produced through other means that mean you do not need to rely on blood moons. Look out specifically for recipes involving stygian acid injection. Soul beads can also curse you to have mobs spawn around you!
        Deeper caves and structures are much more dangerous than the rest of the pack! The places with the best loot have mobs, either from spawners or from depth. Be careful, but if you brave the depths or structures you will be rewarded well.
        The cave generation is a Vanilla+ version of caves with larger caverns and more spacious rooms at the bottom, but more tunnel-like caves at the top.
        The Quark Witch Hat will prevent your items from becoming cursed when a Spectre hits you, and can therefore prove invaluable in Strongholds.
        Need explosion-resistant blocks? Dry Fitted Stone, Rebar Concrete and Plastic-Coated Rebar Concrete all have extreme blast resistance.
        
        Banded Iron veins are your friend throughout the midgame. When you find one, bookmark it in your Atlas.
        Tired of mining? Use an excavator if you've got it, or use asteroid mining. 
        Few materials are not renewable through asteroid mining. Those that aren't, aren't meant to be, and anything you will need in large amounts has alternatives. 
        Cooperite and other rare minerals have pretty small veins. If you want a lot of them, use an excavator to get those large amounts.
        Fluid reservoirs tend to have two versions: a version that spawns everywhere, and one that's place-specific. Place-specific ones tend to have something over the everywhere versions, like larger volume or higher replenish rate.
        All Nether-specific materials are either unneeded or producable from asteroid mined materials once you hit asteroid mining. Other than some super-high-end ores, it's entirely possible to live on a space station indefinitely lategame.
        Trying to think of a way to use all of your oil distillation products? Most can either be burned for power or used to make feedstock. Gasoline is best for power, naphtha best for ethylene. Lubricant can be used for crafting and machines.
        Gunpowder Barrels are lossless! They explode equivalently to TNT, without the mess. If you can craft them and use them to mine pre-drill, they're incredibly helpful.
        Need gunpowder for Gunpowder Barrels? The Nether is a great source of the components! A small trip to the Nether can yield large amounts of gunpowder.
        Core samples, when placed, can have maps right-clicked on them. This puts a marker on them for where you've already sampled. It helps greatly when trying to remember where you've already gotten a sample from.
        Three times duplication on ores is possible, but it needs a different setup per ore. Do it for the ores you specifically need large amounts, such as iron or copper, or for ores you want the byproducts of, like nickel. It tends not to be worth it for ores like lead, which you need little of.
        Steel is the only material it's possible to get four ingots per ore from. You'll need magnesium in your standard molten crude iron and oxygen mix to make four ingots of high-carbon steel, but it's worth it if you need huge amounts of steel.
        
        Mekanism needs both ethylene and a platinum-group metal. You can sluice any ore to get mixed PGM ingots, but later you may want to use straight platinum and save your iridium and osmium for other functions.
        Having trouble finding coal? Charcoal made in a charocal pile gets you up to 4 charcoal per log and is therefore a viable alterative as long as you have trees.
        Circuits become cheaper once you can use silicon to make basic circuits and skip the vacuum tubes. They become even cheaper once you can produce lithium for System on Chip plates.
        Some circuit production recipes need a low-gravity space station for construction. You'll want to keep a manufacturing station close and on demand once you reach them.
        LogisticsPipes, once you can craft them, make automation much easier and simpler. Beware their power cost, though, as electromagnetic accelerators connected to massive amounts of circuits tend to be power hogs.
        Making so many of something that you'd like to make it cheaper? Check for Engineer's Workbench, Extrusion Press, Precision Assembler, or Heavy Metal Press recipes. They usually are cheaper on raw materials but much more power-hungry than other recipes. They can also craft some things in a single go you'd otherwise need two or more steps to make.
        Having problems creating enough coal coke? Having problems with overly much bitumen? Fix both by making petroleum coke out of your bitumen! It affords both coke in large quantities and a good use for the huge amount of bitumen distillation makes.
        Petroleum Coke dust can be made from cracking light gasses down to hydrogen or methane, and can come in large quanties from it. Since almost everything uses the dust and not the lumps, it is an incredibly potent source of coke.
        Need aluminium early but don't necessarily have the resources to set up processing for it yet? Structural Engineers sell varying amounts of aluminium scaffolding, which can be melted down into aluminium nuggets in the Arc Furnace.
        You'll need large amounts of most petrochemical/gas products. Whichever one you choose is up to you, but be prepared to automate it for power and for its resources. It's possible to go almost entirely green and renewable, but your crop intake will be extreme. Petrochemical processing is easier to automate in the long run.
        The Bubble Dome Pressurizer from Magneticraft can help with building underwater, but comes with a power cost to match.
        The Immersive Engineering extracting conveyor belts can be filtered, and can pull from multiple inputs at once! They can extract through item routers to any inventory attached to the side of the router, which allows for filtering and multi-inventory extraction.
        Mekanism gasses can be made in the bottling machine from their respective fluids at an 8:1 rate
        
        The best early-game power source is to go coal or coal-coke powered steam engines. They're pretty simple to set up and easily out-power most other renewable options. They do, however, need a small amount of steel to make the steam engine.
        The more complicated a power source seems to be, the more efficient it will be.
        While it is possible to continue your solid-fuel power generation course into the turbine age with the large solid fuel firebox and boiler, they consume large amounts of fuel so it's best to switch over to liquid-fueled boilers.
        Nuclear fission is unlocked directly after your first spaceflight, as you can then set up your first enrichment centrifuge array. Uranium ore processing, however, can happen before this.
        Orbital solar power is fairly cheap and is constant without interruptions for day, night, or weather. If you want to go solar power, you should use orbital solar.
        If you absolutely must use solar on a space station, the solar array can work even while your station is rotating or while it is dark due to its double-sided nature
        Fusion fuel is renewable offworld. Fission fuel, though long-lasting, requires a planetary base. Your choice for your early endgame power.
        It's possible to breed fusion fuels, but not reccommended. Breeding fusion fuels is much harder than just harvesting helium 3 and deuterium from your nearest local source.
        A working fusion reactor is expensive, but the smallest can fuel four turbines and the largest thirty-two, with no regards to product extraction. With regards to product extraction the range is four to sixteen. As such, they can produce significant amounts of power, far outstripping any other generator.
        For large amounts of energy storage, you have two options: The lossless, liquid-nitrogen-cooled lithium ion batteries of an Induction Matrix or the possibly lossy depending on bearings but susbtantially easier Mechanical Multiblock flywheel.
        Magbearings, while extremely expensive, make the Mechanical Multiblock flywheel lossless! This makes it, overall, substantially cheaper than an equivalent induction matrix, though lower-throughput.
        For those spacefarers out there, the radiator allows you to exchange heat with the vacuum of space through radiative cooling. Use it instead of a cooling tower. For those not spacefaring, you can use a radiator but the cooling tower is much more space and resource efficient if you can support it.
        Fission reactors can overheat, but due to their passive safety systems, only bend and break fuel rod assemblies, necessitating their replacement. Fusion reactors cannot overheat, and, if containment is lost, simply dissipate their plasma and continue to vent miniscule amounts of fuel to the air. Fusion reactions are therefore safer but not too much more so than fission. A properly managed fission reactor setup allows for essentially total safety.
        
        Rocketry is expensive, difficult, and precise, but in the end will net you large rewards. Start working on aspects of it as soon as you can.
        Even basic rockets are large in this pack. A basic LEO-capable rocket is about 9 blocks tall. You'll want at least five engines and a large amount of fuel tanks.
        Make sure your launchpads are large enough to contain the destruction from your rocket launches, as they will utterly ruin terrain around them while causing massive forest fires if too close to flammable materials!
        Satellites too slow? Launch more! A traditional medium-sized satellite loadout is 16 satellites, 8 distance + 4 composition + 4 mass.
        Satellite data production scales with the amount of power they have available - up to 4x the basic production.
        Need some metal on a rocky body in the solar system or beyond? Because of their water and tectonic activity, Earthlike planets are the only ones with ores. Most regolith can be electrolysed when molten to provide oxygen and metals. Some regolith also produces volatiles.
        Having problems getting gems like diamonds or quartz on a space station? The precision hydraulic press works like IRL diamond presses and can make quartz and diamond from asteroid-processing materials.
        Rocky bodies are really only within the inner solar system. Most of the rest is predominately water ice bedrock, and so you'll need to use asteroid mining for minerals that wouldn't be considered volatiles on Earth.
        Gas giants can produce copious quantites of many common gasses, and trace quantities of some rare gasses. Make sure to check their centrifuge recipes for what planet is likely to have which gas type. Some are rich in otherwise extremely rare gasses that are useful for fusion!
        Martensitic Aged Steel is extremely well suited to be produced from asteroid mining. It'll be cheaper overall and use up the abundance of nickel and cobalt you'll get from mining if you use it rather than trying to produce standard carbon steel.
        Stations can be built on the ground and assembled in pieces. Because of all of the necessary infrastructure, this is the reccommended way for the first couple pieces of any station to be assembled.
