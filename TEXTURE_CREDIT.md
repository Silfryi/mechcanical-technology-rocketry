Some textures in this pack for custom items are not entirely my own. They are kitbashed from other textures to make the pack seem cohesive.
Permission has been given for all textures used or converted to greyscale for use.

GPS Unit & Circuit Blueprints are kitbashed from Mekanism textures, created by CyanideX
Perfect Circuit texture and Induction Tablet textures are also from Mekanism textures, created by CyanideX

Mekanism can be found here: https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism

Most material bases (ingot/plate/dust/rod/etc) are from greyscale versions of IE textures. Some ingots in the pack have switched IE textures (mekanism osmium -> LEU with IE uranium textures).
IE textures are from Immersive Engineering, created by BluSunrize and Hazard.
